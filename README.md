# Limerance-This project could be a useful tool for people who have relatives living in different time zones and struggle to find a time to connect due to conflicting schedules.
Step 1: Data Collection
Collect data on the weekly schedule of both you and your relatives who live in different time zone. You could collect this data manually or use existing scheduling tools such as Google Calendar to gather this information.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Once you have collected the data, you need to preprocess it. This could involve converting the time zones to a common time zone, converting the data into a structured format, and removing irrelevant information.

Step 3: Data Analysis
Now that you have preprocessed the data, you can start analyzing it. This could involve identifying patterns and trends in your schedule and your relative's schedule, such as the time of day when you are both free or have overlapping activities.

Step 4: Building the AI Model
Next, you need to build an AI model that can compare your schedule with your relative's schedule and identify the best times for you to connect. To accomplish this, you could use machine learning algorithms such as clustering or decision trees.

Step 5: Deployment
Once you have built the model, you can deploy it as a web application or mobile app. Users can input their weekly schedule and their relative schedule, and the AI model can suggest the best times for them to connect based on their availability.
